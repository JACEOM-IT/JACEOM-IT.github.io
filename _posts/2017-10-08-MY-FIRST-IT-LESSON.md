MY FIRST IT LESSON

Today we started our work on google spreadsheets. We learnt basic skills such as finding products and using formulas. I think that i could have worked a bit better if i tried to use my brain and logic rather than ask someone. However I think I was good at finding shortcuts and easier ways to do things. We also started our main work which is making a shopping system. I think that I did well and coped with the new challenge well however i felt that I didn't understand VLOOKUP that well and as a result i had a hard time doing the homework which was to make an item searcher. In the end I did it but with the help of someone who understood it better. Next time i will ask more questions so when it comes to the Homework i can do it quicker and easier.
